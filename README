eSciDoc Examples
===========================================

This project contains Java examples to use the eSciDoc infrastructure. 
Most of examples based on the eSciDoc Java Client lib, some show requests
on HTTP level (see package simpleConnections).

The code snippets, based on Java client lib, are located in the package 
workingWithClientLib. This package distinguish between examples where the 
class mapping feature is used and examples where the plain XML 
representation via REST services is used.

Class mapping means that all the XML stuff is hidden and one can work in
Java objects (the recommended way).
