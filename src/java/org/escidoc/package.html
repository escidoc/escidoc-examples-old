This package contains contains examples to work with the eSciDoc Core
infrastructure.
<ul>
	<li>simpleConnections - The simpleConnections package contains
	examples which base on HTTP request by using the REST interface of the
	eSciDoc Core infrastructure.</li>
	<li>workingWithClientLib - contains examples which base on the
	eSciDoc Client library. You can find examples which show to use the XML
	representation and REST interface and examples which hide the XML
	representation behind Java classes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starting from Scratch</h2>
<p>Primary data is transfered via the eSciDoc Item resource into the
eSciDoc repository.</p>
<p>Before one can store primary data into an fresh installed eSciDoc
Core respositor one has to create resources to set the way how the
repository is organized.</p>
<p>>These resources are Organizational Unit, Context, Content Model,
and User Account. The resources has to refer to each other, that's why
it's recommanded to create the resources in a certain order. A reference
is usually directed even if the reverse direction could be requested is
it not set.</p>
<p>User permissions are defined via roles. The infrastructure is
delivered with an default set of roles, which could be altered or
extended. With the default role set are Organizational Units, Contexts,
User Accounts and Content Models to create with system administrator
role.</p>
<p>During the standard installation are three users created.</p>
<p>Organizational Units represents real world units of
organizations. This could be the whole research institut but also a
small task group. Organizational Units could be related to each other in
parent child relations whereas this relations could create an
Organizational Unit graph (It has not to be be tree, because an
Organizational Unit could have multiple parents.). An Organizational
Unit refers only to another Organizational Unit - whats a good reason to
populate the repository with Organizational Units first.</p>
<p>The status of an created Organizational Unit is to change to open
before it could be refered from other resources. Call the open method to
change the status.</p>
<p>Remember, one needs system adminstrator permission to create
Organizational Unit.</p>
<p>Contexts are eSciDoc resources to separate the content in a
efficient way. Contexts can only refers to Organizational Units but are
required for Items and Container. Therefore it's recommended to create a
Context as second resource with a reference to the before created
Organizational Unit.</p>
<p>Only Contexts with status open could be refered from other
resources. Call the open method to change the status.</p>
<p>A user with system administrator role is to use to create
Contexts.</p>
<p>If the authentication of your installation is not connected to
LDAP or Shibboleth than it's now time to create a user account and
assign it with the depositor role for the created Context.</p>
<p>A Content Model is to create as forth resorce. A Content Model
describes the resource and could influence -beside other things- the
behavior of the resource which referces the Content Model.</p>
<p>A Content Model does not refer to other resources.</p>
<p>Let's consider: Organizational Unit, Context, and Content Model
are created and you have one user account with permissions to create
Items and Container.</p>
<p>Now it's time to create an Item.</p>
<h2>Steps In Short</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Create Organizational Unit</li>
	<li>Change status of Organizational Unit to open</li>
	<li>Create Context with reference to created Organizational Unit</li>
	<li>Change status of Context to open</li>
	<li>Create User Account and assign depositor role to created
	Context</li>
	<li>Create Content Model</li>
	<li>Create Item with references to Content Model and Context</li>
	<li>Create Container with references to Content Model and Context</li>
</ul>
