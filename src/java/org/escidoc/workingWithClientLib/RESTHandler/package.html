This package contains examples to work with the eSciDoc Java Client
library by bypassing the Java class mapping.

<p>All examples of this package calling methods which communicate
via REST interface with the framework. The XML representation is used
within method calls.</p>
<p>You are supported by XML templates. These templates has to be
altered during a example run. Usually you have to replace the place
holder (###PLACEHOLDER_NAME###) with a value which fits in.</p>
<p>You find detailed instructions,which values are to alter, inside
the classes.</p>

<p>These are code examples to explain the functionality, to give you
a tool where you can start to play with eSciDoc. These are designed to have 
little constrains.<br />
If you building an productive environment it's recommend to use a HTTP
client implementation (e.g. apache httpclient). Using streams is an
advantage of an HTTP client.</p>
